Need to figure out how to pass the parameters around the program using the same global object

Need to rewrite the code to generate a logfile because the streamer for the parameters object doesn't work

Need to figure out how to create an object that can be saved to a root file that inherits from TObject

Need to finish the OOP version of the project so it can be parallelized
